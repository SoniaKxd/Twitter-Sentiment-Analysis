TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

This project explores the sentiment expressed in tweets on various topics. It aims to analyze and understand the public opinion conveyed through Twitter data.

Key functionalities:

Data collection: Retrieve tweets from the Twitter API based on specific keywords or topics. Data pre-processing: Clean and prepare tweet data for analysis, including removing irrelevant information, handling punctuation, and potentially stemming or lemmatizing words. Sentiment analysis: Utilize machine learning techniques (e.g., sentiment lexicons, classification algorithms) to categorize tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. Visualization: Create insightful visualizations to represent the distribution of sentiment across different topics, timeframes, or other relevant factors. Getting started:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (e.g., tweepy, NLTK, libraries for data visualization). Setup: Clone this repository and install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. Configuration: (Optional) Update any configuration files with your Twitter API credentials or other relevant settings. Run the scripts: Execute the provided scripts (e.g., data_collection.py, sentiment_analysis.py) to perform the desired analysis. Further exploration:

Experiment with different data collection methods and keywords. Explore various sentiment analysis techniques and compare their performance. Implement different visualization techniques to gain deeper insights. Analyze the factors influencing sentiment (e.g., specific events, hashtags, user demographics). Consider ethical implications of using and analyzing social media data.
